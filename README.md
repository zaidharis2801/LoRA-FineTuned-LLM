# Fine-tuned Language Model with LoRA

This repository contains a fine-tuned language model (LLM) using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique. The repository includes both the fine-tuning process and the usage of the resulting model.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages. This project requires `torch`, `transformers`, and any other packages specific to your dataset and task. You can install these with pip:

```sh
pip install torch transformers
```

## Fine-tuning

This repository includes the code for fine-tuning a pre-existing language model using the LoRA technique. LoRA allows for more efficient fine-tuning by focusing on the highest layers of the model. It is well-suited for smaller datasets and more specific tasks.

The code includes the necessary steps to load your base model, fine-tune it with LoRA, and save the resulting model for later use. You will need to have your own dataset ready in a compatible format.

## Usage

After fine-tuning, the resulting model can be used for various tasks depending on its base model and your fine-tuning. The repository includes example usage of the model for your convenience. You can adjust this code as needed for your specific task.
